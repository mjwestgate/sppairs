Species Pairwise Association Analysis (SPAA)

This package is built to accompany a forthcoming paper by Peter Lane and colleagues from the ANU. Species Pairwise Association Analysis (SPAA) uses odds ratios to calculate and visualise pairwise associations between species from presence/absence data. It is a simple method that can be applied to site by species matrices in a range of contexts, and provides an alternative to dissimilarity-based approaches. This code is a simple implementation of Lane's approach; we are anticipating that improvements will be made over time.
